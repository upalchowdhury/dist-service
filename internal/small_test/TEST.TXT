why int64

how does if _(blank identifier), err := expression command works

multiline if statement with( short declaration) ;https://go.dev/tour/flowcontrol/6


Encoding:
    encoding/binary package like encoding/json
    Text protocols like json use only printable set of characters in ASCII or Unicode to communicate.
    For example number 45 is represented in "4" and "5" total 2 bytes because they are printable characters but with binary
    protocol like binary pkg the number can be represented using single byte (in hexa - 0x...) which is 50% reduction in space and 
    its native to computer and dont need parsing/conversion.

    For example, letâ€™s take the decimal number 287,454,020 which is 0x11223344 in hexidecimal. The most significant byte is 0x11 and the least significant byte is 0x44.

    big.endian : 11 22 33 44 little.endian 44 33 22 11

    The benefit of this little endian change the size of your number without moving bytes 

    Big endian used for dist servicves talking  over a network protocol (network byte order.)
